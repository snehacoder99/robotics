                <p> 1.Arduino Nano comes with a crystal oscillator of frequency 16 MHz. It is used to produce a clock of precise frequency using constant voltage.  </p> 
                  <p>  2. Arduino UNO is a low-cost, flexible, and easy-to-use programmable open-source microcontroller board that can be integrated into a variety of electronic projects.</p>   
                   <p> 3. Arduino Mega 2560 can be programmed using Arduino IDE software which is an official Arduino software used to program all Arduino boards.</p>
                    
                   <h2> Breadboard </h2>
                   <li><a href = "index.html"> </a><img src= "breadboard.jpg"width="128" height="128"alt= "home"> </li> 
                   <p> A breadboard, solderless breadboard, or protoboard is a construction base used to build semi-permanent prototypes of electronic circuits. Unlike a perfboard or stripboard, breadboards do not require soldering or destruction of tracks and are hence reusable.</p> 
                   
                   <h2> Capacitor </h2>
                   <li><a href = "index.html"> </a><img src= "capacitor.jpg"width="128" height="128"alt= "home"> </li>
                   <p> A capacitor is a two-terminal electrical device that can store energy in the form of an electric charge. It consists of two electrical conductors that are separated by a distance. The space between the conductors may be filled by vacuum or with an insulating material known as a dielectric.

                <h2>  Potentiometer</h2>
                <li><a href = "index.html"> </a><img src= "potentiometer.jpeg"width="128" height="128"alt= "home"> </li> 
                <p>  A potentiometer is a three-terminal resistor with a sliding or rotating contact that forms an adjustable voltage divider. If only two terminals are used, one end and the wiper, it acts as a variable resistor or rheostat.</p> 
                
                <h2> Push-Button-Switch</h2>
                <li><a href = "index.html"> </a><img src= "Push-Button-Switch.jpeg"width="128" height="128"alt= "home"> </li>
                <p>A push button switch is a mechanical device used to control an electrical circuit in which the operator manually presses a button to actuate an internal switching mechanism. They come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and configurations, depending on the design requirements.</p>  
                 
                <h2> Resistor </h2>
                <li><a href = "index.html"> </a><img src= "resistor.jpeg"width="128" height="128"alt= "home"> </li> 
                <p>  A resistor is an electrical component that limits or regulates the flow of electrical current in an electronic circuit. Resistors can also be used to provide a specific voltage for an active device such as a transistor.</p> 
                
                <h2> Robot</h2>
                <li><a href = "index.html"> </a><img src= "robot.jpeg"width="128" height="128"alt= "home"> </li>  
                <p>A robot is a machine—especially one programmable by a computer—capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically. A robot can be guided by an external control device, or the control may be embedded within.</p>
